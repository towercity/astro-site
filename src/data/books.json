It feels intentionally unpleasant, like an unrootedness\n  - Makes it all feel a little arbitrary and meaningless: we don't get the connections between things. In fact they literally do not exist, as they're unwritten. Time pushes ever onward, unconcerned\n  - Eg Clara's new job in 2.2: she just suddenly has it, without concern on struggle, only maybe as the result of the work of a man\n- Overall the grotesquery makes it feel unreal\n- Note that this might be her heavily revised version of the book done later into her career\n- The depression was only like 30 years old when this was written. It'd be comparable to taking off Reaganomics\n- White trashness is the realest focus of this, huh\n- 2.4 is about the reality/unreality of Lowry in her life\n  - And the the rich man Curt seems to have a power (a real one?) hidden within him\n- Part 2 is all this slow sweet exuberant heightened surreal angel conversations, skipped between\n- Because we don't see events but only hear about them, we don't get to know if they're real. See if Lowry's her fiance or not\n- In 2.8, with Revere, she intentionally declares internally she has no interest in reality, isn't moved by it\n- We have constant stories of women destroyed by their first child told by men, then we get to see Clara have a first child\n- Bucking stereotypes, Clara is the main source of violence now\n- 2.10: history and time are now not real\n- Lowry's return really gives us a nice little dramatic novella in the middle of this\n- Just as Clara has no last name, Swan has no solid name: Swan nor Steven contain him. The book is openly, playful obvious with this: the fact that his name is a symbol is more the point than the content the symbol creates at all\n- With Swan's parts, the power themes are even more prevalent\n- And now event event: Part 3 is all starting with novel type events\n[[2022-10-25]]\n- Swan refuses to see representations as the world\n- and even in ch3: the starting \"event\" is a misscarriage\n[[2022-10-26]]\n- chapter four: the event is gunshots\n- /until/ we get to the death... then the patterns broke\n- the disorienting way events just happen, as though meaningless, arbitrary, unwanted. this is very characteristic of her work\n- i feel the swan cahpters a bit of a drop, but idk why yet\n- she deals with American imagery same as [[David Lynch]]: see the violence of Jonathan\n- theres dangling plot thread, i think... watch out for the cousin who crushes on him yo\n- the parts age backward: the dad is older than clara is older (maybe, least at their respective starts) thn Swan\n- characters deal with the uncontrollability of life, even in small decisions \n- ch9s first line, plotwise, cancels out all of 8\n[[2022-10-27]]\n- One of the last scenes: Swan has a doctor's visit, so plain\n- The rewrite was in 2002\n- but it isn't so much a novel about victims as it is about the ways in which individuals define themselves and make of themselves “Americans”—which is to say, resolutely not victims.\n  Her quote","review":"","whyRead":"","slug":"joyce-carol-oates-a-garden-of-earthly-delights"},{"title":"A Sentimental Education","author":"Joyce Carol Oates","started":"undefined","finished":"undefined","status":"read","cover":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nbhznGWTHTIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","content":"![cover|150](http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nbhznGWTHTIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api)\n\n> [!example]+ logbook: \n > 1.

It's shifts into soap operatic melodrama, mystic violence, and other solidity-denying things too often, denying the very social reality it describes. Again, a major compliment. This IS the way of life in the American empire: one of fantasy.\nSomewhere Oates said she wrote this quartet to describe how much she hated America, and god damn if this one doesn't show it.

Fascinating really. We know they're there, but this feels like a different reality from then&#x2026;. They're passing between\n-   And the meaning of each 'type' of demon: is the skelly good? Is puck bad?\n-   2022-10-16: we get potential meanings for symbols too: is the skelly night the old emporer we see in flashback?\n-   its all *significantly* more emotional than advertised (this is a positive). griffith's re-discovery in the dungeons, eg, is played not for gore but sentiment\n    -   which then makes the descriptions of torture after worse: we read these as happening to someone about whom we care, not just a comic caricature\n-   immediately followed by hyperviolence, which leaves me cold, indifferent\n-   unlike griffith eye closeups, which tell us nothing about his thoughts, only that he *is* thinking\n-   the violence now is getting *real* extreme (the rape monkey scene)\n    1.  is it simply bad taste? is it intentional?\n    2.  it really builds a whole `criminal == bad` argument too, as if this were Law and Order SVU\n-   the face art in demon world&#x2026;..cool as hell\n-   so hard to tell if silent griffith wants this&#x2026; he only *wills*\n-   Guts made griff forget his dream: turned him, in other words, human\n-   its harsh, watching guts talk to the dying version of all his named comrades\n-   \"this is to be human&#x2026; this is to be evil,\" a demon says as griffith ascends\n-   \"this is the reality you must walk through from here on,\" the skull knight tells guts\n-   guts fights against the term \"destiny\"\n-   terms: dreams, destiny, will, want\n-   guts dream: violence unto demons. how do we analyze or feel onthis?\n-   Casca's child (lets here just skim over the way her womanness is done now&#x2026; unsure how to read it (yet)) is another Guts, to the extreme: born of horrible death\n-   Guts is given option to stay with ppl, including casca, instead of revenge, doesnt\n### Conviction Arc\n> [!list]- logbook\n> 1.

The prose style is so over the top, honestly, that it /has/ to go metaphysical. If it's calling such attention to itself, it becomes central. It's a text about a text, hidden behind its content.\n\nAnd its content: it's /much/ worse than advertised. It's /solely/ reliant on its reader to hate it, the moral version of an incredibly dry joke. So of course I love that. It's got hella issues---hella issues---but I tend to be ok with them, for the attempt.\n\nAll though, of course, it's meant to be salacious. That's meant to gather readers etc. That's part the point of it.\n\n(Final thought: odd to read this now, so forward, so modern, when it's from before my parents were born. Lolita is older than them, I mean the character.

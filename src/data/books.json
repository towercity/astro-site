Fascinating really. We know they're there, but this feels like a different reality from then&#x2026;. They're passing between\n-   And the meaning of each 'type' of demon: is the skelly good? Is puck bad?\n-   2022-10-16: we get potential meanings for symbols too: is the skelly night the old emporer we see in flashback?\n-   its all *significantly* more emotional than advertised (this is a positive). griffith's re-discovery in the dungeons, eg, is played not for gore but sentiment\n    -   which then makes the descriptions of torture after worse: we read these as happening to someone about whom we care, not just a comic caricature\n-   immediately followed by hyperviolence, which leaves me cold, indifferent\n-   unlike griffith eye closeups, which tell us nothing about his thoughts, only that he *is* thinking\n-   the violence now is getting *real* extreme (the rape monkey scene)\n    1.  is it simply bad taste? is it intentional?\n    2.  it really builds a whole `criminal == bad` argument too, as if this were Law and Order SVU\n-   the face art in demon world&#x2026;..cool as hell\n-   so hard to tell if silent griffith wants this&#x2026; he only *wills*\n-   Guts made griff forget his dream: turned him, in other words, human\n-   its harsh, watching guts talk to the dying version of all his named comrades\n-   \"this is to be human&#x2026; this is to be evil,\" a demon says as griffith ascends\n-   \"this is the reality you must walk through from here on,\" the skull knight tells guts\n-   guts fights against the term \"destiny\"\n-   terms: dreams, destiny, will, want\n-   guts dream: violence unto demons. how do we analyze or feel onthis?\n-   Casca's child (lets here just skim over the way her womanness is done now&#x2026; unsure how to read it (yet)) is another Guts, to the extreme: born of horrible death\n-   Guts is given option to stay with ppl, including casca, instead of revenge, doesnt\n### Conviction Arc\n> [!list]- logbook\n> 1.

[[2022-11-11]]\n\n-   so the last one really was just&#x2026; an episode. and now we have the demon horse again, to add continuity\n-   i guess melania following is the storyline from last time&#x2026; lest jill comes back\n-   here: guts takes on jesus\n-   the obvious excess of melanias whipping of guts: noteable. thn she prays for forgiveness\n-   really though: w/o other deep characters (not the elf), a lot of wha i liked from gold era's&#x2026; gone\n-   i think lady'll be the fix for that: she whips herself: so strife\n-   the dogs look cool as hell\n-   guts is such a dick to melania in this chapter (but promises character interaction)\n-   holy shit does this get expicit!\n#### Birth Ceremony Chapter\n\n> [!list] logbook\n> 1. [[2022-11-11]] - [[2022-11-26]]\n\n-   so much in this: sentences cut off with ellipses, as cliffhangers: only characters, not us, know\n-   this is like the introduce characters series of arcs, huh\n-   is the hawk the elf?\n-   wait&#x2026; griffith? i thought *EVERYONE* died from the golden age. was i mistaken with just them after, in the field? is this the girl who loved him? another person?\n-   so many returning characters! the demon they fought before, Zo. very unexpected\n-   even Casca's return is like a reminder of before: don't forget where this is from\n-   scary, funnyhead man\n-   the story plays a fine line with 'guts is so cool' vs 'guts is a very strong headstrong idiot'\n-   holy god damn the holy orders torture chamber\n    -   \"This hellish spectacle is one aspect of the holy see to which you belong\"\n-   they really,,,, like what do you take of the women in this? comment on society? but a fantasy society? its obviously thematic, but hard (still) to parse\n-   its easy to pretend guts in the only mc, but there's so much time w/o him&#x2026; the other characters matter too\n-   mozgus also prays via torture\n    -   why he has such a face\n-   in a demon scene, calls sin a form of eternity (showing massive orgy)\n-   they really do casca dirty after the timeskip wtf\n    -   can she command demons?\n-   lol, bone wheels stolen also\n-   the skull knight is like an elf, says puck\n-   catatonic casca: the demon worshipers can sniff her out\n    -   is she remembering things now?\n-   the goat man calls the raping \"mingling with\"\n-   is cacsa's demon deal different than guts? she seems to unintentionally summon\n    -   are they the dead of the torture chamber?\n    -   well,,,, it ate them at least\n-   farnese begins to see demons here\n    -   and blames guts\n-   Mozgus: \"It is through death that we espy faith\"\n    -   he tries to make the dead demon repent (makes him seem&#x2026;. more honest in belief, i guess)\n-   angle wings&#x2026;.

The prose style is so over the top, honestly, that it /has/ to go metaphysical. If it's calling such attention to itself, it becomes central. It's a text about a text, hidden behind its content.\n\nAnd its content: it's /much/ worse than advertised. It's /solely/ reliant on its reader to hate it, the moral version of an incredibly dry joke. So of course I love that. It's got hella issues---hella issues---but I tend to be ok with them, for the attempt.\n\nAll though, of course, it's meant to be salacious. That's meant to gather readers etc. That's part the point of it.\n\n(Final thought: odd to read this now, so forward, so modern, when it's from before my parents were born.

### Ingredients

- Red Onions, undefined
- Vinegar, 1 part
- Water, 1 part
- Salt, a big pinch

### Instructions

- Very thinly slice the red onions from root to stem and add them to a jar.
- Add equal parts vinegar and water to a pot (use enough to submerge the onions in the jar) with a big pinch of salt (2% by weight if you want to measure). Set the pot on the stove and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat.
- Pour the hot pickling liquid over the onions until they are completely submerged or the jar is filled.
- Cover and let sit in the fridge for at least 2 hours before serving. The pink color will get deeper the more days they sit (keep in the fridge). 
- Put them on everything & enjoy.

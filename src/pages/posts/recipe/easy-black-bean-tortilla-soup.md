### Ingredients

- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1  large sweet onion (diced)
- 3 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 teas ground cumin
- 2  chipotle peppers (seeded and diced)
- 2  15 oz. cans black beans (drained and rinsed)
- 1 Â½ c. sweet corn
- 1  28 oz. can diced tomatoes
- 4  corn tortillas (chopped)
- 1 qt. vegetable stock
- Salt and pepper
- 6-8  corn tortillas (sliced)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 teas chili powder
- 1 teas kosher salt
- 1 teas black pepper
- Fresh jalapenos
- Limes
- Cilantro

### Instructions

- In a large dutch oven, add olive oil and diced onions. Cook until onions are translucent over medium heat, about 3-4 minutes. Then add minced chipotle peppers (opt.) and garlic. Stir to combine.
- Add in drained and rinsed black beans, corn, and tomatoes along with vegetable stock. Bring to a simmer.
- Add in chopped corn tortillas and simmer on low for 10 minutes. Tortillas should mostly dissolve. Season soup well with salt and pepper.
- Serve soup with any all garnishes you want, but most importantly crispy corn strips (or corn tortilla chips in a pinch).
- For Crispy Corn Strips:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Slice corn tortillas and toss with olive oil, chili powder, salt and pepper. Spread them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
- Bake corn strips for 15 minutes, stirring once halfway through.
- Remove corn strips and let cool. They will continue to crisp up as they cool.
- Freeze this soup by letting it cool down to room temperature. Then transfer to freezer safe bags. Stores in the freezer for up to 3 months. Reheat slowly on the stovetop.

### Ingredients

- 1 tbsp of olive oil
- fresh dill, how ever much makes your heart sing
- juice from 1/2 lemon
- 1 cup of pasta (i use veggie-based because they have hella protein)
- handful of spinach
- 1 tbsp of vegan butter
- 1/2 can of chickpeas
- salt and pepper

### Instructions
while the pasta is boiling, saute the chickpeas in a pan until theyâ€™re browned a bit or however you like them. turn off the heat and then put the handful of spinach on top and cover the pan so they can wilt.

when the pasta is done, drain it, put it back in the pot with the butter, dill, and lemon juice. turn the heat back on and add everything in the other pan and add a bunch of black pepper and a little salt.

-----
### Notes
- add a little salt or spice blend when ya cooking the chickpeas dingo!
- dried dill is fine
- parm on top? you vegan-killer
- try garlic next time?

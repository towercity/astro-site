this weekend i participated in a game jam at wonderville. we had 2hrs to learn ren'py and make a game with it. 
in my team, i did the writing. all this below was in ~1hr, no erasing, no thinking ahead. it was fun, huh

also, note, it doesnt actually use any ai. that's a lie, or maybe an attemt to seem more modern

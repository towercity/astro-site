finally uploaded this game jam game from a while ago: [j.konger.online/flat-game/](https://j.konger.online/flat-game/).
it's finally not a joke one. i did the writing mostly, which is a found/erasure poem from an old religious text

here's the poem text:
<pre>
  i vow that my body shine bright in the infinte night, /
for all beings are like me,

  i vow that my body is crystal, the same as compassion, /
dreams on track,

  i vow i shall grant all beings my exhaustible wisdom, /
reviling guilt,

  i vow to lead those astray /
let them be corrected,

  i vow sentience, relapse, violation /
sincerity's a tenet of regret,

  i vow the physically sick are in good / health,
all who pay homage,

  i vow pain as i vow povery:
the helpless will be helped,

  i vow suffering and torture, transformation /
into men,

  i vow free beings, evil thought, control /
incultate them in a righteous honour,

  i vow to save prisoners of disaster /
my supreme power blesses the freed,

  i vow those who suffer from starvatio /n:
hear my name,

  i vow suffer, povery, mosquitos /
wasps by day and night come by my name,
</pre>

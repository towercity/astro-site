last week, i started revisions on my little novel of derealization, _The Girl_, and continued on it this week. been doing it mostly during lunch breaks, for about an hour, and took the weekend off. our girl just made her way through the third door. things will soon unravel

also: attempted an intro paragraph to reimagined versions of _Kossler!_ in my head while walking to the library, then on my phone in the cold outside, struggling to move my fingers right. lets hope its worth it

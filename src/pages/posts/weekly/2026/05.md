S-- is deeply deep into learning Steno, even practining on weekends, so while sitting with her on the couch (outside too cold to want to leave the house) i've got back into final fantasy 7 remake. get this: i love the battle system. i love the jokes. navigating is difficult in a high fidelity world but i dont care, i still enjoy it

but here we are, in a place meant for writing updates. this is not a final fantasy spot

i've been stitching together parts of Scott and Bianca and i love it. its fun. im attempting to write freely and foolishly, like on the blog, following a discursive pattern first then character, story. after all: these characters are very distant from themselves, caught in machinery. im also doing some more translations, Meet Me In A Dream, but my current one, abt Cola Cola, is dense with words i dont know, or playful terms, thus it takes longer. i _may_ look into joining a local japanese language group to force myself some new accountability. if so, ill decide by tomorrow

I THINK WHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS that I LOVE GRAVITYS RAINBOW

i would like to be making these posts much longer now, or at least more detailed, as in retrospectives or
narratives rather than posts. i imagined it as a "resolution" of sorts. but this week S has had a fever,
and im mostly caring for her

writing: i've been sporadic and i've been slow. this is required. the week between christmas and new years
is the actual holiday week: time to rest and look at snow and in exaggerated distress ponder if next year
it will come. i worked on Scott and Bianca and translations

(im writing this in a put upon rigid voice)

(i am watching a movie as well right now)

the BIG EVENT of the week (sleepy, januarily) was finally putting up pictures on the walls. they 
are not ALL up, but let's accept the facts: this new apartment, bc theres more rooms, has more 
waals, and so many more places for pictres. we have an unreasonable number (2) of tvs. puctrires are what you put up to be forgotten. happy memories slide back in time

i am, for no reason other than my own, attempting to watch a movie a dayand review on [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/towercity/), so see mee there

week 7 of 2026: a week's worth of weeks. a week of weeks. im weak

of note: finished translation of [coca-cola](/posts/meet-me-in-a-dream/30-coca-cola/) from meet me in a dream—an itoi one. never know where to put my paltry advertisements for those, as there's (so far as _i_ know) not a huge collection of itoi fictions fans, ya know. earthbound places? my feeling is they're more a fandom place interested in their rpg friends, so id be only selfishly self-promoting.

instead i leave it here for you folks, guess: enjoy, my possibly existnt readers

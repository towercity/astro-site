one tires of the weekly blog post; one wants to write new ways; one has returned finally to both revision and translation, of The Girl and Meet Me In A Dream; one wishes to write a Short a Week, fool of productivity; one has health issues, doctors appointsments; one will be published soon, more info coming; one reads Garielle Lutz, the best of the literary; one struggles to sleep; one reads Thomas Bernhard; is ones reading gone morose?; and Hunter X Hunter; of Montreal; watch Eurovision; plays rpgs; have you ever eaten fish so good it keeps you up all night?; one's stomach fails one; one is making WordPress blocks

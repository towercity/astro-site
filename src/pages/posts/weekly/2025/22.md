[weekly flash](https://konger.online/posts/writing/weekly-flash/001-an-analysis/)? yes; and revisions, translations, etc

a family visit; little project time; but reading, still, yes!

i only finished the rehearsal this week

confession: my guilty pleasure is watching productivity videos and judging the hosts: buddy, why don't we just LIVE. i started with a new therapist this week for this and several other issues. how will it affect this unread posts?

goal: be productive in order to be more productive; use the extra time to spread the productivity word; its a form of jesus

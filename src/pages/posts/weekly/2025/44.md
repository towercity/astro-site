did you notice i took some weeks off from these posts? in fact it was a month, at first under the assumption I'd do a whole [weird web october](https://j.konger.online/wwo/), but after a few days i approached feeling burnt out, so i stopped

then (this is the joy of having no readers) i decided to finish skipping out the month. why not? even now i have no reports on my writing, tho i wrote a lot. just trust on that, its an achievement

other:
- i made a [bookshelf](/books) for my site. its arbitrary and incomplete now, but im glad to have it. maybe check back later to see more
- zohran mamdani is the mayor. this happened yesterday. i found out at the Boris show, on the phone of two tall guys talking in front of me. it was during 'a boa a qu', which i'm sure means something

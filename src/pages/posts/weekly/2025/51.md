i’m away from home and my lovely shell scripts so instead of recording all i’ve written (scattered fragments and stories, and a return to my three daughters, if i recall), have a list of things i saw in the airport, my favorite semi-public place:
- a trend of men with oddly manicured eyebrows, or at least eyebrows shaved into patterns i didn’t recognize 
- a boy looking out the window comparing the approaching cityscape to minecraft, which he has open on his switch
- unfortunately that’s all i wrote down and it’s been days since i been there
- i wrote an essay about airports on tumblr once and someone liked it, but then i deleted my tumblr and i don’t remember what it was like

goodnight, sleep well dear readers. i’m gonna watch youtube and do flash cards :)

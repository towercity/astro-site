MOVING WEEK. THIS WEEK I HAVE BEEN PACKING UP ALL MY THINGS. BOOKS WERE VERY QUICKLY INACCESSIBLE 

### Writing
listened to a real long text-to-speech mp3 of The Girl, a revision strategy. i think its basically done, but i gotta fix a lot of typos. also did some self-translation and got notification of acceptance to a mag. ill post info here when that's public

### Other projects
little bit of ants. did a game jam over the weekend, oughta post my work up here soon

### Books
very little reading, compared to my baseline. most of my books are in boxes, most of my free time's been spent putting things in boxes

### Other
predominantly:
- podcasts, while moving. they require the perfect amount of focus, aka 'slight'
- Case of, Rise of the Golden Idol, on breaks, to fall into wonderful puzzling trifles of delight

i also watched blues brothers for the first time ever; it is bad

## Writing
only revised 'The Girl' one day this week, as I've been doing some story revisions for submissions: my cigarettes and my ponce de leon story, both of which (i noticed this week) pull the same sort of sudden shift into the absurd to explain abstractions. i've got techniques

in submissions: sent my hans story in, reading a few for another place. i actually recorded where this week, but i dont know if its like verboten to post this in the semi-public world of the blog. but i am, as they say, working now

## Other projects
little of note. i was sick this week, as an excuse

## Books
of interest:
- finished Solenoid, by Mircea Cărtărescu, after months. i have opinions abt that

## Other
- lots of sickness and Zelda
- watching the new severances now

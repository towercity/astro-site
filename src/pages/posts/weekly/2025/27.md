finished my draft of "The Girl". _swear_ I'll look for publishers soon. its a bit of a weird one, low on the 'sellability' deal, so i'll likely be looking for publishers myself, seeing if there's a horror/weird fic place who might want it. at this point (less than a week from revising), i think its nice. there is a place for it

didnt post my flash last week, i forgot. that just means i get another chance to revise it for this week. ha ha ha ha ha

a weekly flash! its more likely than possible. a fly (quite large) is trapped between my screen and my windowpane. we are six floors up. i have typed, as well, The Girl; i have attempted some self-translation

will the ants return? yes! with a retooling

have i read much? yes! of course

let's take a moment to adore Ducks, Newburryport. thank you

let's take a moment to fall into the beautiful mid-point of new movie Sinners

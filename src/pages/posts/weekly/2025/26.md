this week i finally got back to some consistant working on this most recent The Girl revision. lines 3311 to 4543, for those of you who have my markdown file. this is where we got switched the most, from one sort of dissipation to another, a more explicit embrace of themes of war. really im just happy with it cause it has two of my favorite short stories tucked within

also finished a draft of We Mimes in japanese. no clue what to do with that now, as im certain its full of grammatic errors and nonsense, but i dont know if i care enough to pursue proofreading to fix this. where is the line between my silly translation being public and private, so to speak

and i also did a flash again. be looking out here thursday, ill put it up maybe

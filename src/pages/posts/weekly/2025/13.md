this week was another allergy week. turns out im allergic to cats. i have two cats, and have for years. i have become a weaker person now!

## Writing
typed up a revision of my buffalo story and submitted it. let's hope it goes well

also worked on some translations and just the littlest bit of revisions for The Revolution. as stated above: a weak of allergies (get it? get it?), which i may just have to adapt to now

## Other projects
tryna learn nginx stuff to rehost a few websites, getting back into the fun of the pico ants. overall, calm but steady

## Books
normal patterns. the new html review came out and i adored [new legibility](https://thehtml.review/04/new-legibility/) from it

## Other
been playing some ufo 50 again, now that im mostly done with the zelda; started watching belgian de mol; caught up with White Lotus and cringed in the corner of my sofa

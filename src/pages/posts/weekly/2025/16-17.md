missed a week unpacking, so we've got a fascinating double week today!!

### Writing
revisions and submissions, both good uses of sparse time

### Other projects
sorta messed with a golden idol webgame, mostly moved things out of boxes into closets and shelves

### Books
finally got some books out, also doing audiobooks. of note: loved Duma Key and Between the World and Me; reading (thank god) Herman Melville; bought a copy of the complete Garielle Lutz

### Other
still:
- podcasts, while moving.

also:
 - saw LAKE live
 - The Rehearsal episode 2, best ever

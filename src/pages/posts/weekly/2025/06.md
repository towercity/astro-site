## Writing
still on 'The Girl'. only wrote 4 days this week, got into the next step of disassociation. we're into the nightmares, the soldiers, the bars

in addition:
- finished a new intro to Kossler on my phone. its nice to write in the notes app. i havent done so in a decade
- another submission. im trying to submit on thursdays now, but i'm still not recording (oops). maybe later i'll have details that count

## Other projects
- made a [really stupid game](/posts/renpy-game-jam/) at a game jam
- still writing on the ants. had a very busy week outside the home, so i haven't done much

## Books
dipped into proust some. lots of short stories, of course. again, busy week, right. right? right?

## Other
Nope! I played lots of zelda instead of reading. Tears of the Kingdom. i am in an imagined world, wondering around. i am chilling it the depths. im really enjoying the game, for only being pointless

also went to a david lynch drag tribute. someone did a striptease as the lost highway mystery man (10/10, transcendent)

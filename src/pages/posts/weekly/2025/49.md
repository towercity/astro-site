bc it is december and bc its therefore holiday season, we put our tree up for
the year and watched terrible christmass movies. its a cultural thing: once
child actors no longer bring us celebrated joy, we put them in intentionally
bad holiday movies, as a humiliation ritual. this, the tv says, is why you
never should be famous. its better being quiet, after all

(what i mean to say: i finished revising the first half of the Revolution this
week: exciting. it was my goal to get it by the end of the month, and i was
(thankfully) done by the third. now i only need a way to publish)

never content to one project, i'm adding a revise of Uncle Konig to my write-load, my wierd western tale about how little i enjoyed living in Lousiana, as well as some shit about america and violence, same as everything else ive ever wrote. originally it was an overstuffed short story of the "i write short stories only, i swear" type; now its as long as it needs to be, or at least im convincing myself just a novella

also experimented, for the first time this week, with writing the markup for the interactive fiction of My Three Daughters. it's a bigger chew than i imagined i was biting (or whatever), so maybe look out for smaller web-first projects as i build it up in parts? we'll see

further:
- looking into short story subs again, wanna consitant rhythm
- i think i found an agent to submit The Girl to. need to get over my nerves, read their manuscript wish list, and judge with open eyes

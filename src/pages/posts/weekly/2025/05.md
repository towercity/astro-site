## Writing
continued revisions this week for 'the girl'. disassociation and derealism's begun. in essence, i worked on the part where its just a line of uncomfortably sequenced short stories with only hints of delineation, so of course i love these parts

in addition:
- messing with more heightened kossler fantasy voice. is it tending too bola√±o or bernhard? perhaps. but that just leads to more joyful revision. 
- submitted somewhere. tbh i forget, cause im not back to keeping records yet. hope they adore me
## Other projects
drafting out new devlogs for my ants, often away from home and on my phone, in lines for bathrooms

## Books
of note:
- started JG Ballard high rise, hell yes
- back to Solenoid (taking in a section again as audiobook). by the time i finish ill likely have been reading for six months
- read a couple tiny indie comix

## Other media
- Ethel Cain never made sense to me till Perverts. Now I will defend her to the death
- [i liked this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJzV0CX0q8o&list=WL)
- saw Dan Deacon perform at a ballet; it was so damn good that he wasn't even the highlight

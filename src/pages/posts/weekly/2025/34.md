wrote a lot this week! i'm happy with that, as I'm sure you are too. you are, after all, by point of fact, at least while you read this, one of my readers

most exciting (for me), I submitted The Girl to an agent. in doing so, i wrote a couple summaries of it, which felt (surprisingly) nice. i like the book. i like its gimmick. here's to hoping this agent i sent it to feels the same way

also: less interesting single story submissions, to magazine, who will love me and publish my work; also: retooling notes on the classic "Uncle Konig"; also: working on Meet Me in a Dream translations (a difficult Ito story, our guy is slangy and referential in a way that takes real effort)

more fun for me tho was attempts to do some "web art" work, baby-stepping an engine for my three daughters with a fun little flash about a magic bomb (aint it always with me a bomb? who can accuse me of re-using my symbols?). web art's fun

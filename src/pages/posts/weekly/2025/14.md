got access to a new apartment this week, so really started moving in earnest. we got an overlap in leases (call me mr. money, its alright), so its been a daily back and forth, cleaning and bringing small things across town

### Writing
scattered yet productive. working at random on shorts, touched The Revolution the one day I had time

### Other projects
i fixed up the posts page on here to have pagination AND full post content, like a beautifully crowded stream, like a model of the gunky mississippi; tried for some reason to learn NixOS, i dont know why, probably cause im moving and thus swinging around in my mind

### Books
gave up on a william vollman book (too much lol), trying to read more japanese

### Other
white lotus finale, white lotus finale, white lotus finale

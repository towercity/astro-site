recovery week, revokery week, allergy symptoms rising week, alright

## Writing
notes app flash, old story revision, translations when i have time

onto ch 2 of the Revolution and quite happy with where it is. trying to solidify the so-callable internal logic, in order that the pointless continuity is even more solid, as a thematic thing

## Other projects
fixed my rss feed, posted another devlog for the ants, tryna learn math. all this inevitable

## Books
started the audiobook of Wittgensteins Mistress: that's a book _made_ to be read aloud, despite everything. started complete Garielle Lutz and loving it. [the eternal present - by kate wagner - the late review](https://www.late-review.com/p/the-eternal-present) was good

## Other
on a neil young kick. fooled with the Pathologic 3 demo till i accidentally went to the menu and erased my save. saw my yearly of Montreal at Brooklyn Steel on sunday

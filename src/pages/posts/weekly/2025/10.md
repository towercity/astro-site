a calmer week, a recovery week; attempting to resume a manic style

## Writing
finished another draft of 'the girl'. i really like this one now, its solidifying into something. in a month or so i'll re-read and see how i feel about it, if its ready for desperate attempts at notice by the world

also thinking of new ideas for 'the revolution', adding a thematically facetious "generative" style

## Other projects
cooking, posting, finished reading the manual of pico-8. in addition i made a stack of personal randomization cards, as a method of navigating life without control

## Books
went to several bookstores. new york's nice. there are so many book stores. 

## Other
- now, after swans, ive been listening to michael gira solo projects. i get the impression he might be a violent man
- also: stevie wonder, secret life of plants. imagine an alternate world where he kept this style up, avant-light synthesizer songs, pop-style blue gene tyranny..... i loved this album lots
- went to some live tv recordings 
- still playing zelda. i dont wanna stop lol. its very good

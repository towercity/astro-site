mac and cheese. it _must_ be baked. stovetop is a different meal and we all know
this but to chance the names would deny our language its fluidity, which im
thankful for, ok?

(submitted twice, its an end of the month thing. returning to Lucas and Diane
for some lovely new additions, otherwise working the same; started tv-watching
house; first week off of work (dont worry, vacation); saw kevin barnes live in
nyc again, im like those people who love phish and all their versions)

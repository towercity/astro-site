big week: apartment searching and (unfortunately) terrible anxiety upswell. .Ë™. week of low creativity

## Writing
a week of revisions mostly. did line edits to my Ponce de Leon story and typed last week's revisions of my first cigarette story up. both stories were fun to return to

also, got interest back from an agent for Kossler!, two or three weeks after i decided to give up lol. i submitted the whole text to the agent, i hope they want to represent me!

no the girl revision this week though, gotta get back to that

## Other projects
none lol, see above

## Books
nothing much of interest, slower week. started reading about DBT, for reasons obvious

## Other
- listened to lots of post-2010 swans
- listened to a lot of Tom Scott lateral podcasts
- played a lot of zelda
- caught up with severance

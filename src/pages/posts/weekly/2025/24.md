can you tell im bored of these weekly update posts? i am, and yet i have set a self-imposed limit on myself, thus i must follow it completely, thus i must do it on and on

or I can change it, maybe do it monthly for all but writing updates, which ill keep here

thus:

i revised a cigarette story for publication upcoming..... check that here. that marks two cigarettes stories in print (or virtual print). maybe ill put a page out for them here

also: doing some translations as well. they are slow because im bad at them, but the more i do the less bad i will be. more posts on them soon (in a paragraph or so, i believe)

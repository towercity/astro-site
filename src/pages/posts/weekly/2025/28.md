yeah this week's title is weird, this weeks title is fucked, but i've been doing them all as quotes from things ive read or listened to during the week and I completely forgot to look for any this week, so all I got is a quote from King of the Hill i saw at a werid al concert (dont worry im ashamed) which has not left my mind since i heard it. weird al yankovich blew his brains out in the 1980s after people stopped buying his record. this is probably true

but i aint wrote much this week. i've had some therapy 'homework' (boo) that involved journaling this week, which took up a lot of my bandwidth and, of course, writing hours. so i have been just so woefully unproductive

however: that's right, this sunday i rode on a plane, which is a place i just can't stop writing, im always writing nonstop on planes, its near admirable. so there, plane-side, middle seat, i got back into my fun little novella _Songs About Men_, added a few pages to it. it might be my next project: a fun, entirely unmarketable one, just for myself

anyways, my condolonces to weird al and his family in this tough time. i hope his funeral dirge has something to do with food, or at least a plot summary of some mid movie or television

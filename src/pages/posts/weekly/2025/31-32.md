limiting this weekly post to just my writing updates while also mostly working on one single new project is, in fact, quite boring. all i have to say for the last weeks is: I've been writing more on the Three Daughters piece (see long devlog in blog below). what's the fun in that?

instead, for my loyal readers, see this: while fevered up this weekend, i started on a bookshelf page of all the books I've read or tried to read. i keep incredibly meticulous notes about them, its crazy. [here's some years of books, not built up enough to give you any additional info](/books). they are, of course, in random order, re-run each time my blog is updated

till next time

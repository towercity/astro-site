i always enjoy writing on the train. atm i work from home, so i dont ride it every day, but when i do (and when its empty enough and not shaking enough that i can do all it comfortably), i like to bring a notebook or tablet and scrawl. this weekend i drew on the J and wrote on the Q. years ago, i wrote on the S going home from a job i hated

(this week i revised revolution 2 and fiddled with code for "we dropped the bomb")

## Writing
another 4 day week for 'The Girl'; i got sick at the end of the week. we're at the 
point now of highest violence now (i think), or at the very least when her personality
vanishes. this is the heavy shit

in addition:
- wrote more Kossler! on my phone
- revised "Hans" for a submission. i haven't sent it in yet, but i will this week,
assuming i feel less sick soon

## Other projects
- reading the pico-8 manual, for fun and pleasure

## Books
of interest:
- [The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haunting_of_Lin-Manuel_Miranda):
this play slaps! Ishmael Reed is indominable
- stated How To Read Nancy, which has been great

note: i oughta get to work on puttin my reading log here, as well in public. one
of these days, huh


## Other
- saw "His Motorbike, Her Island" as the Japan Society near the UN on Valentines 
day, a movie by the director of House, it was nice

I was watching one of those gossip shows.
Friends had told me the tarot horoscopes they did were scary accurate. They read them out at the end of the program’s hour.

My fortune–I’m a Scorpio–was positive.

“Have you ever found a lost gold ring?” a woman in gypsy costume said with a conspiratorial confidence. “Your weekend will feel lucky as that.”

This sounded alright to me. Joyously, I chose to plan my day. I’d try something new, I’d be real brave. I was still essentially a child.

Next the woman read the cards for Pisces. She pulled a five of clubs.

“Beware of nightclubs after 5,” she interpreted.

Young and dumb and fully undissuaded, I stood from the kitchen table and considered my luck.

As usual, that day I’d slept in late.

_Mister All-Night_: that's what they call Jokichi.

Other pimps stay up all night as well, but they aren't _Mister All-Night_.

Every night, after the 11PM baseball report's finished, he lets out an "Oh".

This _Oh_ more or less means _Welp, I'd best get going_. Who is he telling this to? No one's there to hear him.

During business hours, Mika-chan's busy working: bubble dances, periscopes[^1], the like.

Nonetheless, the exact same time Jokichi that says _Oh_, Mika replies, "Aii." It's nothing more than a single, private _Aii_, bothering no one. No customer for example asks her, "What's that about? _Aii_?"

Jokichi is Mika's pimp. "You simply have to be my pimp," she'd told him once: certainly a generous offer. She's often felt she must be in love with him, or something like love leastwise. This is what she thinks of as she works, though only absently, so as not to neglect her current customer. The possibility of feeling a love toward Jokichi is unquestionably a personal affair, thus not something to think of at the office, so to speak. Nonetheless (her customer's penis peeks above the surface of his bath, she moves to mount it) Mika wonders, in her heart, if the feeling might not interfere with what she's doing.

At the apartment Jokichi absently undoes the electric lock. He's off to jog. His eggplant-purple tennis shoes bounce one after the other over the hallway's red carpet.

Jokichi skips the elevator and descends the emergency stairs. It's the end of fall, so his breath is white. Jokichi's at his happiest when the Yoimuri Giants win. Mika-chan moved in with him in April, April's the baseball season's start. The Giants had played the Chunichi Dragons. Come to think of it, opening day had been rainy and just as cold as now. Then, as happens with time, the weather warmed and since then chilled again. The whole while Mika-chan had lived with him. _Something like happiness, huh_, Jokichi ponders. His happiness wasn't caused by the Giant's success, this much was obvious. Were they to only reach third place this year, in other words, he and Mika-chan would continue as they had. _You're bring dumb_, he thinks, in other words.

He takes a break from jogging halfway to Mika's storefront and starts to sing: "Dabada dabada badabadabah! Dababada-dah! Dabadaba-yoo-hoo!" It's just passed midnight.

Jokichi sits on a bench, wipes his sweat, looks to the sky. He calls for Mika-chan.

Simultaneously she looks to the sky and thinks of him. They share a promise.

The way stormy days often clear by evening: so it is with them.

Unlike his other girls, Mika gets off at 1AM.

While she changes back into clothes, Jokichi stops by a 24-hour drug store. He calls a taxi after and gets inside. He drinks canned coffee and catches his breath. Soon Mika-chan will be there to meet him. She will jog up to this spot as well.

Why do they do this so much? He doesn't know. It seems to make her happy that they meet up at this place.

They return the apartment and shower together, then Jokichi reads to her aloud. His voice ekes out his mouth, his quiet voice just at her earside. He reads like this to her till 2AM.

Next: thirty minutes asking Mika how she feels while drinking beer.

Once the dawn breaks, they have sex. Mika-chan has lots of sex for work, so with him she wants it slow and sweetly. Gently, sleepily, Jokichi moves sweetly and slow.

They go to bed.

Just before falling asleep Mika asks Jokichi, "Same tomorrow?"

"Hmm", he says. He rolls over in his sleep.

_Yes, I want to be with him tomorrow,_ Mika thinks. She smiles and falls asleep as well.

The planets had aligned and thus a pimp materialized---an intelligent friend had told Mika this once. "Don't be silly," Jokichi had said when she'd repeated this to him. Mika, at the time, had laughed as well.

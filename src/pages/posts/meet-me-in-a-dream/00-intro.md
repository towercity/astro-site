a few notes on my translations of Meet Me In a Dream:
- this is not the most accurate translation you’ll ever find. my interest in the project is mostly literary, and my japanese might be called “studied but inept,” like a novice monk in 1500’s latin
- i know of the other partial translation online, but i’m not consulting it, for same reasons as above
- respecting authorial intentions, as expressed in the books foreword, i will not be marking who wrote what on this page. that’s only there with the stories themselves
- let me know what you think, imagined reader. contact link’s there in the menu

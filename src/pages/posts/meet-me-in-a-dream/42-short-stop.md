So—is it the shortstop who scores points? (A certain friend of mine (much older) asked me this.)

Well, in a sense they can (I answered), but really their point is preventing other teams from scoring runs.

Ahh, yes I remember that. They make *out*s.

Yes, that's true. But remember: plays can also be ruled _safe_.

Right, safe. And are _short-hops_ related to shortstops?

Well, beyond the similarity in the words, I guess a shortstop could always short-hop a ball.

I see.

My friend went on and on with a real impressive amount of questions. E.g:
- Is the *bullpen* where they keep the strong?
- Where on the field is the *slash line*?

This guy—you can never give him a clear answer. No matter what I say, it doesn't take.

Sometimes all I wanna do is sigh and tell him, Look man, that's a homerun, that one's safe. Et cetera.

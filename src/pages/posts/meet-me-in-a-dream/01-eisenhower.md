September 26, 1958, evening: it grows dark on the Brooklyn Bridge. Sonny Rollins is alone, practicing his scales on a tenor saxophone. 

“Hey old man,” a child passing by asks him. “Whatcha up to?” 

“Fightin the atomic beast,” Rollins says. 

“I bet,” the child answers. “That’s a lie.” 

...

At that very moment, President Eisenhower leads troops through the deserts of New Mexico, to struggle life and death against a repulsive and real atomic beast, which has four large, scissor-like pincers. 

“Mr. President, if it keeps like this, the world will be destroyed,” the Secretary of the United Nation announces to the war room, exhaustion audible in his voice. “Our weapons cannot match it.”  

“Lord, forgive us,” the president growls. “We’ve given birth to that which can’t be born.” 

_Snip snip snip snip snip_: the beast advances. It crushes tanks and soldiers in its way. 

...

“Hey, you got my donuts?” my nine-year-old self asks ask my mother. Her back is to me, in the kitchen, so I raise my voice.

* An assistant mustn't eat any pastry their employer's set aside for later.

* An assistant mustn't turn away clients because their employer finds them beautiful.

* An assistant mustn't toss their employer's stale tea away on their own discression.

* An assistant mustn't use word such as "like" or "um" when speaking to their employer.

* An assistant musn't wish for a nicer chair or salary than their employer.

* An assistant mustn't add the term 'manager' to their business card.

Given all this, from now till the end of time, I do not intend t become an assistant.

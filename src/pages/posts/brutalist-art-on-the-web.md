its always plain text, default font, white background. its checkerboard transparent stand-ins, equal-width characters, source code visibility a must. i feel it pretends to
a sort of transparent modernism, a text describing its own creation apparatus, but 
why then does it seem to me so nostalgic? these are all signifiers of old ways of using
the computer, old by the time i got my first laptop (which was a very long time ago now).
it feels like a stranger letting you know something awful dot com is the originator of online culture, not 4chan like you were taught. i guess it comes off like a pose, is what it feels like. _i'm not coddled byt the convenience of modern computing_, it tells you. _i'm an operator, eyes inside_

<small>brought on by seeing [this](http://www.thebibleasahyperlink.com/), though really this is a reaction to almost everything, a tantrum of things i dont understand</small>

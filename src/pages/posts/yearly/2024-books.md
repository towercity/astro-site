## Stats 
i read 160 books and i will not apologize for this even if no one wants me to
## Favs (in no order)
### Ishmael Reed - Mumbo Jumbo
I already knew I loved it, but haven't read it in years. Got a copy with birthday money. There’s a certain wholehearted embrace of the movie of it, but not in contrast with the historicity of it. in short: what if da vinci code was actually good
### Hirohiko Araki - Jojo's - Steel Ball Run
Hirohiko Araki understands america. The president, under the thumb of business, is searching out the corpse of Jesus. I believe that this actually occurred 
### Kenzaburō Ōe - A Personal Matter
My second Oe, and my first of his earlier, crasser stuff. It’s so good, like a plainer Faulkner! I’m current reading Silent Cry now, which ofc colors how i look at this one, but still: the cruelty, the hopelessness, the selfishness. Oe knows how to dig a massive hole
### Alison Bechdel - Fun Home
Borrowed from a friend, read it in two days, immediately bought a copy. look, there's a lot to say about it, but let's be honest: proust is a major organizing force in the book. i have to love it if only for that
### Helen DeWitt - The Last Samurai
Not my first DeWitt (see below), but DAMN is it a good one. i almost want to call it a full fledged defense of never being dumb, of intelligence not as some bourgeois self-inflation tactic or calvinist method to enter into the chosen, safe forever, but damn, who cares, the book's just nice. it gets perhaps my highest compliment ever: the book feel like it simply _is_
### Heinrich von Kleist - Michael Kohlhaas
one hundred and something years ago, some little dude took in a big breath and then, before he'd pushed it out, he'd written the funniest fucking maniacal revenge story ever. i get why kafka called him brother. getting some mad at someone over nothing you destroy your own life and the lives of those around you is simply the essence of 2024
### Jack Womack - Random Acts of Senseless Violence
one of my favorite books ever. equal parts parody and tragedy. maybe i love it cause i was raised conservative. what if the fears of the suburb types were right? what if the america really was a terror? people will still have to live
## Other Notable Books
### Genzaburo Yoshino - How Do You Live
Read because the Ghibli movie, which is really different. The movie is a fantasy about how one lives after fascism, the book seems to be about how to live _within_ fascism, or at least a nationalist proto-fascism. Very relevant to the present, huh :(
### Helen DeWitt - The English Understand Wool
it's my first DeWitt, and still the funniest book i've read in ages. i read it in one sitting at a fast-food restaurant waiting for food (this isn't a brag, it took FOREVER), then i bought all the rest of her books
### Earthsea Books
I had sampled these before without much interest (not the fantasy type). I liked them more than expected, tbh, mostly The Tombs of Atuan and Tehanu, the slow ones I guess. Still not a huge fan, but I'm glad to have like.... seen em.
### Franz Kafka - Amerika
Every Kafka book is in and of itself notable
### Haruki Murakami - The City and Its Uncertain Walls
First full-length japanese novel I’ve ever read
